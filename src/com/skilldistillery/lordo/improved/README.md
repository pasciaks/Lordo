Discussions regarding this repository will help derive a well planned OOP structure that can be used to implement such a text based adventure game.

### REFERENCE: LORDO - Application Overview

We are going to make a game! 

Well, as much of a game as you can make in the terminal. 

You may scoff, but some pretty awesome games were made way before the PC era with only text input. 

It is in this spirit that we are going to create our very own 'Lord of the Objects'.

Don't believe me?
