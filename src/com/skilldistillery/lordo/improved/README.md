- Planning, Improvements and efforts to improve Object Oriented Principals

Discussions regarding this repo will help derive a well planned OOP structure that can be used to implement such a text based adventure game.

The repository shall be used to continue to spearhead the development of an improved OOP structure.

Please feel free to add an issue as a way to comment on these ideas and suggest improvements.

Forking this repository and submitted PR's is also suitable, although I don't believe there will be much action here, we'll see.
