### Application Overview
We are going to make a game! 
Well, as much of a game as you can make in the terminal. 
You may scoff, but some pretty awesome games were made way before the PC era with only text input. 

It is in this spirit that we are going to create our very own 'Lord of the Objects'.

Don't believe me? 

Check out this [Zork Adventure Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)

#### Our Lord of the Objects...
- You are on a magical journey through an enchanted forest in search of hidden treasure!
- As you venture through the forest you will encounter three different enemies who wish you dead.
- Every enemy you happen upon will provoke you to battle!
- Losing to an enemy will result in your depleted health levels.
- On your journey you may also find yourself among a forest witch.
- If found the witch will provide you with a potion that restores some of your health.            
- This is our starter OOP project - created by Ashley, Mary and Sheldon, in 10 hours or less!

#### Technologies Used
	- JAVA
	- Eclipse
	- Git/GitHub
	- Sublime Text Editor
	- Zsh

#### Lessons Learned
    - Deciding the MVP behavior is a good start.
    - Planning a good OOP design will help accomplish future tasks.
    - Sharing the work load maximizes our effort.
    - Trello free Kanban boards are a good Project Management tool.

## Lord of the Objects



#### User Story #1
When the program starts, the user is welcomed and presented with a list of available commands.

#### User Story #2
The game continues until the user (now called player) either dies (is defeated), or the player retrieves the treasure (or prince/princess/grammy/banana...what-haves-you).

#### User Story #3
The player must fight enemies (trolls/orcs/koopas/Beliebers...etc), who have health and attack damage.

#### User Story #4
Each time an enemy is hit, it will strike back, unless it is dead (defeated).

#### User Story #5
The player takes cumulative damage over time; if the player's health is depleted, the player is defeated.

#### User Story #6
If the player defeats three enemies, they retrieve the treasure and are victorious!

#### Stretch Goals

* The game described above is very simple and extremely linear. Introduce randomness into the damage to spice things up a bit.

* If you've ever played an RPG, you know games like this are all about the gear. Introduce the ability for the player to collect a randomly dropped item after he/she defeats an opponent. Have this item improve the player's stats in some way.

* The world is your oyster! Go nuts! Give the player the ability to move from location to location, have more enemy types, maybe even a boss.
